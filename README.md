Project Overview and Problem Solving


In the project folder, GPIO pins are used to send SOS and OK signals through LEDs.
In "Project1," a thermostat model was created. Both projects focus on utilizing GPIO pins, timer control, and learning how to use these features effectively.

What Did You Do Particularly Well?


State machine control played a critical role in these projects.
In the first system, it was important to ensure that the state machine executed processes in a specific sequence without interruptions, enabling the system to function correctly.
In the second project, state machine design ensured tasks were performed in the correct order.
I believe I did an excellent job establishing this system. I dedicated significant thought to the state machine's structure to ensure a smooth system operation, adding control mechanisms to prevent potential errors. This aspect of the project showcases my skills the best.

Where Could You Improve?


As seen in the differences between the two projects, I adopted a different approach to data structures.
I believe there is room for improvement in this area. Using appropriate data structures is crucial for efficiency, readability, and scalability, so further development in this skill is necessary.
Tools and/or Resources Added to Your Support Network
The most important resource was the project documentation. However, it was somewhat outdated. For example, the UART library is no longer supported and has been replaced by UART2.
The critical resources I used were the TI UART2 Reference Page and TI UART to UART2 Porting Guide.


Transferable Skills


State machine design, which I believe is my strongest skill, is a transferable ability applicable to nearly all projects.
Proper sequencing and synchronization are vital in most systems, making this skill highly valuable for future projects.

How Did You Make This Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?

I followed ALLMAN notation to write readable code.
I grouped related parts of the code together to enhance clarity.
I designed a modular system, breaking it down into functions wherever possible.
This allows new features to be added with minimal adjustments and ensures easier future development.
The modular design also facilitates adaptability across different systems.
